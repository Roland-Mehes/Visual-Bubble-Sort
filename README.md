# Animated Bubble Sort Visualization

Welcome to my animated bubble sort visualization project! This is a fun and interactive way to understand how the bubble sort algorithm works by visually showing the sorting process step by step.

## Live Demo:
You can try out the live version of this project here: [Live Demo](https://roland-mehes.github.io/Visual-Bubble-Sort/)

## Features:
- **Interactive Sorting**: You can generate a random list of numbers and watch how they are sorted using the bubble sort algorithm.
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: You can control the sorting process using buttons for:
  - **Start**: Generates a new random list and begins sorting.
  - **Play**: Automatically plays the sorting animation.
  - **Next Step**: Manually advances the animation to the next sorting step.
  - **Previous Step**: Go back to the previous sorting step.
- **Visualization**: The numbers are represented as vertical bars, and their movement during the sorting process is animated to make it easier to follow the algorithm.

## How It Works:
1. The `bubbleSort` function takes a list of numbers and sorts them using the classic bubble sort algorithm.
2. Each time two numbers are swapped, the new arrangement of the list is saved as a new animation step.
3. The animation steps are played back in order, showing the movement of the elements as the list is sorted.

## Tech Stack:
- **HTML**: Markup for structuring the page and the layout.
- **CSS**: Styles to create an interactive and visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for the sorting algorithm and the animation steps.

## Usage:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the app.
3. Click "New" to generate a random list of numbers.
4. Click "Play" to start the animation, or use the "Next" and "Prev" buttons to navigate through the sorting steps.

This project helped me practice JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and CSS animations. I hope it serves as a useful tool for anyone wanting to understand how bubble sort works in a more visual and interactive way!
